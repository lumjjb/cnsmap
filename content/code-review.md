Minor changes to a workload, or the infrastructure where the workload has been deployed, may have far-reaching security
consequences. To mitigate the risk of unintended consequences, teams are encouraged to use the "[four eyes](https://www.unido.org/overview/member-states/change-management/faq/what-four-eyes-principle)"
principle when conducting code review before changes are merged into the codebase (e.g. implementing a pull request in git workflow).
